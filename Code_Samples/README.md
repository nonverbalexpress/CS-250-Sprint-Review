# Code Samples

This folder contains practice coding exercises completed during CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle. These exercises supported skill development in preparation for the final SNHU Travel project.

## Included Projects

- **Basic List View Control Project:**  
  A Java-based graphical application displaying a list of five top travel destinations. Each destination includes a name, a short description, an image, and a link to a travel package. This project focused on building skills in list management, user interface customization, and incorporating multimedia into applications.

- **Slide Show Project:**  
  A Java-based slide show application where images and text were updated to meet new Product Owner requirements. This project emphasized modifying existing code to align with changing specifications, managing graphical resources, and properly commenting code revisions.

## Note
These projects were completed as individual exercises during the course and are not part of the final Sprint Review deliverable. They helped reinforce skills in Agile development workflows, user story implementation, and software modification practices.
