Sprint Review and Retrospective Reflection

## Essential Questions Reflection

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?  
I interpret user needs by gathering feedback, understanding user goals, and translating them into actionable program features. Creating user stories helps by organizing user needs in a clear format that connects goals to functionality. This makes it easier for the team to prioritize and build exactly what the user expects.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?  
I approach program development by breaking work into small, manageable parts and using iterative cycles to adjust as needed. I plan to continue using Agile processes like sprint planning, daily standups, backlog refinement, and retrospectives because they help teams stay flexible, improve communication, and deliver better results through continuous feedback.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  ##
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, supporting teammates, staying dependable, and being flexible when changes happen. It also involves collaborating respectfully, helping resolve issues quickly, and keeping the team’s goals as the main focus. I am not afraid to fail and believe that failure is part of the learning process. I continue working through challenges until I succeed.
